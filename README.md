## ðŸ“– Overview

**Fuzzy-DoGNet** is a lightweight and interpretable deep neuro-fuzzy system designed for **Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)**.  
It integrates **learnable Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) filters**, a **multi-scale feature pyramid**, and a **feature-map attention module** with an **Unstructured Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (UNFIS)** classifier.  

This unique combination achieves **state-of-the-art accuracy (99.72% on GTSRB)** while remaining computationally efficient (~1.9M parameters), making it well-suited for **real-time, resource-constrained deployment** on embedded platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.
